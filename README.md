Francesco Franzese

STEP 1 : 
Run ApiTuiProject Console to test application

When the application has finished , it produces a stout text file with the following information: 

"Processed city [city name] | [weather today] - [wheather tomorrow]"

The file is included in the following folder : 

"ApiTuiProject\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestData"

In this case I have extract one record in that file :
[Processed City] Binnenstad|Patchy rain possible-Partly cloudy


I have created an excel file with the following information :

name	wheather date	wheather condition
Weesperzijde	2021-11-25	Patchy rain possible
Weesperzijde	2021-11-26	Patchy rain possible



Please you have to enable a method WritExcel in row nr. 96 present in file Program.cs
For internal convention I have disable this method.
An excel file with that information will be produced in the following path :

"ApiTuiProject\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestData"

STEP 2 :

I attach a document that describe api
