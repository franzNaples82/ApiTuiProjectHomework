# ApiTuiProject

Francesco Franzese

STEP 1 : 
Run ApiTuiProject Console to test application

When the application has finished , it produces a stout text file with the following information: 

"Processed city [city name] | [weather today] - [wheather tomorrow]"

The file is included in the following folder : 

"ApiTuiProject\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestData"

In this case I have extract one record in that file :
[Processed City] Binnenstad|Patchy rain possible-Partly cloudy


I have created an excel file excel with the following information :

name	wheather date	wheather condition
Weesperzijde	2021-11-25	Patchy rain possible
Weesperzijde	2021-11-26	Patchy rain possible



To enable a method Writeexcel , please decomment the row nr. 96 in  Program.cs.


STEP 2 : 

I attach a flow diagram.
