# ApiTuiProject

Run ApiTuiProject Console to test application

When the application has finished , it produces a stout text file with the following information: 

"Processed city [city name] | [weather today] - [wheather tomorrow]"

The file is included in the following folder : 

"ApiTuiProject\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestData"

In this case I have extract one record in that file :
[Processed City] Binnenstad|Patchy rain possible-Partly cloudy
